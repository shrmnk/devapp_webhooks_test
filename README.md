# devapp_webhooks_test

Koa.js-based server to test Webhooks from Meta Developer Platform

1/ Deploy to heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Configure `APP_SECRET`, `VERIFY_TOKEN` under config variable settings for your project from the [Heroku developer dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/):
* `APP_SECRET` is obtained from the [Facebook developer dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) for your app. This is needed to verify that an update came from a Facebook server.
* `VERIFY_TOKEN` is your "password" for setting up a webhooks subscription - specify a unique string that you will be placing in your subscription dialog

2/ Setup your webhooks subscription from the webhooks dashboard on facebook for your app. 
* The URL should be your app URL and /webhooks, e.g. https://{heroku-url}/webhooks
* The verify token should be what you configured in the previous step.

3/ While it is running, it will list received webhooks updates in chronological order at https://{heroku-url}, and you can also look at heroku logs for any errors.
